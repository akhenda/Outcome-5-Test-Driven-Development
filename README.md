# Outcome 5 - Test-Driven Development

This repo has been created as a demonstration of Test-Driven Development skill attained in Outcome 5. As an aspiring Andelan, I now know what tests are, how to write them, and how the TDD approach can be beneficial in development.

## This repo contains:
1. At least 10 test cases for a FizzBuzz function.
2. A function called data_type, that takes one argument, compares and return results, based on the argument supplied to the function.  It also has tests that must pass to produce the perfect function that accounts for all expectations.
