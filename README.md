# Outcome 5 - Test-Driven Development

This repo has been created as a demonstration of Test-Driven Development skill attained in Outcome 5. As an aspiring Andelan, I now know what tests are, how to write them, and how the TDD approach can be beneficial in development.

## This repo contains:
1. At least 10 test cases for a FizzBuzz function.
2. At least 20 test cases for OOP assignment.
